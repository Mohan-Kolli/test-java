Migration and Modernization of OCP APIs on Azure ASP: Key Accomplishments

As part of a recent initiative, we successfully migrated the critical OCP APIs—DOM, AOCPG, AOCPR, AOCPD, and OCPHP—from OpenStack to Azure ASP. This transition brought in significant technical advancements, security enhancements, and optimizations, summarized below:

1. Modernized Infrastructure:

Migrated from JBOSS servers to Spring Boot, leveraging an embedded Tomcat container with Java 17, creating a lighter, more efficient environment.



2. Enhanced Security and Compliance:

Identified and remediated all known security vulnerabilities.

Enhanced OCPHP IMS connections to support TLS 1.2, fortifying compliance and improving data security.

Integrated Pingfed authentication into AOCFD and OCPHP UI login systems, providing seamless and secure access.



3. Optimized Codebase and System Performance:

Enhanced logging capabilities, streamlining root cause analysis for faster resolution.

Refined the codebase by removing deprecated features and unused OCPHP code, improving maintainability and performance.

Upgraded AOCPD’s UI/UX from JSP to the latest Thymeleaf, resulting in a more user-friendly experience.



4. Improved Efficiency and Scalability:

Introduced Redis caching for database operations, reducing outbound requests and improving response times.

Overcame mounting restrictions of NAS database calls in AOCPG by implementing on-demand file transfers for both AOCPG and OCPHP.

Implemented efficient overnight schedulers, ensuring only a single instance manages tasks for AOCPG.

Migrated document storage from server to Redis cache with auto-removal, eliminating the need for L1/L2 support and improving resource allocation.



5. Enhanced Functionality for Administrators:

Redesigned AOCPD admin UI, granting the ability to download and delete failed files alongside a listing of PDF documents for streamlined administration.



6. Improved System Performance and Load Handling:

Redis cache server now facilitates UDP handshake between AOCPD and OCP Client, enabling seamless horizontal scaling.

Removed redundant FTP schedulers from AOCFD, reducing server load and increasing efficiency.



7. Streamlined and Standardized API Structure:

Removed XML-based dependencies from all APIs, resulting in a simplified, maintainable structure.




These upgrades demonstrate a significant enhancements of the product, technology, security, and operational efficiency, enabling us to support growing demands on the DNA platform effectively.
